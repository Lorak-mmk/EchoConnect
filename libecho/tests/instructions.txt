BitReceiver(win_size, lo_freq, hi_freq, left_lim, right_lim)

1. pick a window size, high frequency and low frequency
2. picking a left_lim:
	- run [info win_size lo_freq], while [wave win_size hi_freq] is running
	- run [info win_size hi_freq], while [wave win_size lo_freq] is running
	- pick the larger one
3. picking a right_lim:
	- run [info win_size lo_freq], while [wave win_size lo_freq] is running
	- run [info win_size hi_freq], while [wave win_size hi_freq] is running
	- pick the smaller one
4. picking a diff_min (BitReceiver.cc:121):
	- run [step win_size lo_freq (right_lim-left_lim)/2]
	- while it's listening, run [wave win_size lo_freq]
	- between 2 and 4 numbers should appear, pick the smallest one
	- do this a few times (you don't have to restart step), and pick the highest minimum
	- do this for hi_freq too, and pick the larger one
